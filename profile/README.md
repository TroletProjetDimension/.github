# Trolet â€“ Dimension Measuring Project

In the scope of Trolet's e-commerce, a solution to reduce the number of purchase returns needs to be implemented. This repository seeks to become this solution. The current proposed solution will include a companion-app as well as a tool equipped with sensors that will communicate together to measure shoes, provide an interface to do so, and integrate with the current e-commerce platforms to process listings.
